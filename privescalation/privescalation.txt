Privilege escalation is the absence of authorization or a weakness in implementation that leads to granting acces to resources or actions beyond the intended level of authorization.
The secure code prevents this by using a session for each authentication so that if a user has logged in before, the session is set. 
Additional security mechanisms to deploy to prevent this vulnerability should be things to prevent session spoofing like setting cookies to HTTP only and preventing cross-site requests by expliciting setting sameSide to "true".
If the session is leaked, this can still lead to spoofing. One way to prevent this is to use tokens/2FA.
