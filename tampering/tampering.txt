Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is when an attacker injects a script into an application, changing its functionality and potentially gaining access to a user's sensitve information. 
The secure version of this server prevents this by sanitizing the user input so that it can't be executed as HTML or JS on the website.

These tampering attacks violate the Integrity property of the CIA triad.
