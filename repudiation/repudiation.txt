- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
Non-repudiation refers to an inability by a system to attribute actions on a system to a specific user. This is often because of a lack of log files or audit policies.
The secure version prevents this by using a log stream to record some message whenever an endpoint is hit that includes either the username or source IP.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Prevent logs from being edited by just anyone. Policies on auditing these logs are also important, including automatic log analysis.
You could also implement the same measures you would take to prevent spoofing, because if an attacker spoofs another user, their actions would look like they're coming from that user.
