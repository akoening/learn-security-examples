- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
A denial of service attack is one that prevents clients from accessing a server/resource by crashing the server by exploiting a vulnerability or overwhelming it with too many requests.
The secure version of this server prevents this by using a try/catch statement to handle bad inputs. 
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Rate-limiting, input sanitizing, load-balancing to handle high traffic loads (implemented through a firewall or a Content Delivery Network).
