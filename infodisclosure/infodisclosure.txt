Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The insecure server is vulnerable to a SQL injection which allows an attacker to pass in a SQL command as a parameter and dump information from the database, resulting in an info disclosure.
The secure version of the server prevents this by checking to make sure that the user input is a string and then sanitizing it to remove any special characters that might be part of a SQL command.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
Confidentiality and potentially Integrity if the attacker sends a command to delete or change something in the database.
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
Encrypting data that is stored in the database, so that even if it is accessed it can't be read.
